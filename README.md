1) Install Docker:
  * [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
  * [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
  
2) In the root folder, run in the terminal/cmd `[sudo] build .` and then `[sudo] docker-compose up`. 
You should see now that the application is listening to port 9000.
